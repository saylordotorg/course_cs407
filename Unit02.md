**Unit 2: Object-Oriented Programming in Java** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will review the basics of Object-Oriented Programming
in Java, discussing the fundamentals of classes and objects, function
creations and calls, and encapsulation and data hiding.  If you have not
yet created multi-threaded Java applications, the second part of this
unit will introduce Java threads.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 14 hours to complete.
