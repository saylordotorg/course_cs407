**Unit 3: Threading in Java** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced Java threads.  Some problems/tasks
need to be subdivided with each piece running concurrently without being
visible to the end-user until all of the subtasks finish.  This
simultaneous processing is accomplished by the multi-threading feature
in Java.  *

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 6 hours to complete.
