**Unit 4: Transporting Text Across a Network** <span id="4"></span> 
*By now, you know that you can receive input from users and generate
outputs using a subset of streams on a local machine.  In this unit, you
will learn how to create streams to receive input and write output.  You
will focus on writer and reader stream classes, ultimately learning to
open writing and reading streams across machines on a network.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 12 hours to complete.
