**Unit 8: Transporting Function Calls** <span id="8"></span> 
*In the last unit, you learned how objects can be transported across
networks so that other programmers can use those objects’ methods.  This
unit will introduce a different method of object sharing: initiating a
function call on a certain object type when the object resides on a
remote machine by using Java RMI and SOAP.  The unit will close with a
discussion of programming excellence including program correctness,
robustness, and efficiency.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 12 hours to complete.
