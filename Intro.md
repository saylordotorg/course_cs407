Course Syllabus for "CS407: Network Applications Development"
-------------------------------------------------------------

User dependency on the Internet increases every day; nowadays, everyday
tasks like paying bills, communicating with others, and applying for
jobs are all routinely carried out via the Internet.  While the Internet
represents a huge network, it is meaningless without the applications
that it supports.  These applications enable user interaction and
facilitate everyday activities.  In this course, we will learn about the
design and implementation of network-based applications, focusing on
Object-Oriented Programming and programming techniques both at the
application layer and the transport layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack. 
Additional concepts covered include text transport (moving text from one
computer to another over the network), data transport, object transport,
remote function calls, and, finally, class transport.  You will approach
these concepts from an Object-Oriented point of view, learning to
implement design patterns in your code in order to ensure software
reusability (a highly desirable feature in network applications).

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Code solutions using the fundamental concepts of object-oriented
    programming in Java.
-   Compare and contrast the usage of the Java APIs for each of the
    different network protocols with emphasis on the application and
    transport layers.
-   Explain how consistency and reusability are achieved in network
    processing from input through output.
-   Complete a variety of introductory to complex network programming
    tasks utilizing Java.
-   Solve problems that use XML to activate Java.
-   Compare and contrast object sharing with Java RMI and SOAP.

### Course Information

Welcome to CS407 Network Applications Development.  Below, please find
general information on this course and its requirements. 

**Course Designer:** Rose Wise

**Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   <span dir="LTR">David J. Eck's [Introduction to Programming Using
    Java,](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/)</span> 6<sup>th</sup> edition
-   <span dir="LTR">Oracle's [ J2EE(TM) 1.4
    Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/tutorial/doc/About.html#wp63721)</span>

**Time Commitment:** This course will take approximately **90 hours** to
complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of
time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help you
plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at these
time advisories and determine how much time you have over the next few
weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for yourself.  For
example, Unit 1 should take you 9 hours.  Review your calendar and
schedule to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 2 hours) on Monday night;
subunit 1.2 (a total of 4 hours) on Tuesday night; subunit 1.3 (a total
of 3 hours) on Wednesday night; etc.

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Unit 1, as this unit will lay the groundwork
for understanding object-oriented coding and the more advanced
programming concepts presented in the later units.  You will also need
to complete the Final Exam.

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Tips/Suggestions:** You will be using two major online texts for
reading assignments in this course.  You may want to download them to
your personal “e-bookshelf.”  The sites do not require any personal
information. 

Review the Preface in each text for information about additional usage
tips for each book.  Once you download the enterprise java book,
navigation does not automatically use your file name.  For that reason,
each subunit includes the file name you may need to open manually.

-   <span dir="LTR">The enterprise text is a minus-one edition of the
    version currently for sale by the publisher.  The free CD may no
    longer be available, so it is not required.  </span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Be sure to use the links to the Oracle website,
    which provides tutorials with the most current information.  </span>
-   <span dir="LTR">The best way to learn is to actually code, test, and
    run all examples and exercises.  The more you do, the more you
    learn!  </span>
-   <span dir="LTR">If you have a problem with a program, step away for
    a glass of water or a brief walk.  Then, review the code anew for
    what is there, not what you want to be there.  A fresh look at it
    usually will help you identify the coding flaw quicker.</span>
-   Some concepts can be presented in different ways.  Therefore, if you
    are confused by your text, refer to any of the other reference
    materials in the unit as they present the same material, just in a
    different style.  Seek understanding, not just completion.
