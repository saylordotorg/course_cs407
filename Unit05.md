**Unit 5: Text Transport Using UCP and TCP** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to new programming skills – more
specifically, programming skills on the transport layer of the TCP/IP
stack.  This unit will begin by providing you with a layered view of the
Internet, focusing on the UDP and TCP protocols in the TCP/IP stack.  We
will then learn how text can be sent over the network and identify the
principles of creating UDP datagrams or TCP segments, packaging text,
and transferring it from one machine to another across the network.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 10 hours to complete.
