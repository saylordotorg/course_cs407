**1.3 Review of Basic Object-Oriented Concepts** <span id="1.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: Hobart and William Smith Colleges: David J. Eck's
    Introduction to Programming Using Java: “Chapters 1-4”**
    Link: Hobart and William Smith Colleges: David J.
    Eck's *Introduction to Programming Using Java*: [“Chapters
    1-4”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/CS407-TEXTBOOK.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please review Chapters 1 through 4.  Start with the
    quiz at the end of Chapter 1, and use the link provided by the
    author to check your answers.  If you missed a question, go to that
    concept in the chapter and review that concept.  Repeat this process
    for Chapter 2.  If you miss several questions, read all of Chapter 2
    and try the quiz again.  Once you feel comfortable with the material
    in Chapter 2, proceed to Chapter 3.  Repeat this process for
    Chapters 3 and 4.     
        
     These chapters assume Java is your first programming language. 
    They are included here so that you might review programming
    terminology before jumping into the material for this course.  Be
    sure that you are familiar with all of the concepts in these
    chapters, especially if it has been a while since you took the
    pre-requisite programming course.
